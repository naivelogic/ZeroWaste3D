# ZeroWaste3D on Clean Ocean

Objective: Train accurate detector for detecting waste in ocean/waterways to aid in reduction of polution and waste contaimination.

### Summary

1. Generate synthetic dataset of important objects using Maya
2. Train detector using Faster RCNN networks on generated synthetics dataset
3. Fine tune detector with real world data




### Results 

Performance of the training results is compared using the Mean Average Percisions scores.

| DS.0 Synthetics Only (#30K) - (3 class) | 0.39 | 0.47                | 0.XX         |
| DS.X Synthetics (#XXK) - (#classes) | 0.XX | 0.XX                | 0.XX         |
| DS.X Synthetics (#XXK) + Real (XX)  | 0.XX | 0.XX                | 0.XX         |

### Dataset Geneartion

Syntheitics objects were generated by rendering the 3D models with varations in object positioning (e.g., object angles) and lighting conditions. 

* XX 3D models used in syntheitcs images generation pipline
* XXK images were synthetically generated

3.20 Taking into account relevant international standards, establish a nationally consistent framework to enable ships to discharge clean segregated recyclable materials at Australian ports to divert this waste from landfill

### Training Experiments

Dataset 0 training only utilized sythnetics dataset and only a selected number of categories to establish an initialbaseline. 

* 80/20 train/test split
